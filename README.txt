Just a little background info on this bit of code:

While it's my goal to do an increasingly more amount of backend Drupal development (hence my applying for this position), I have only written 4 or so modules and this is by far the largest of them. I'm really just getting my feet wet when it comes to practical backend development (in a full-time job), but I am thoroughly enjoying it - especially after a few years of working full-time as a frontend developer/site-builder.

This project is something I worked on at Webspec as virtually the sole developer (front and back-end) on behalf of the governor's office. It was a crazy whirlwind of a project with constantly changing requirements and super-short deadlines which at times lead to decisions that made development quite difficult and very unconventional at times.

I'll be happy to go into more detail (if desired), but the piece of code I've attached is a webform handler that is used to turn textarea values (strings) into objects ("Paragraphs" entities) that get associated with the city/county/town that submits the form.

I look forward to answering any questions you have, and to hearing any constructive criticism you might have to offer!
